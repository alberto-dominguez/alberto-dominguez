- 👋 Hi, I’m Alberto Dominguez
- 👀 I am a physics, calculus and computer science teacher. My main interest is in financial economics, previously using traditional numerical techniques, but recently I have become interested in the application of reinforcement learning (RL) techniques to the subject.
- 🌱 I’m currently expanding my understanding of Matlab's and python's RL capabilities. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on RL as it relates to portfolio performance analysis and prediction.
